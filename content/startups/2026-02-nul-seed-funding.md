Summary: London-based digital health startup Nul announces a €840,000 Seed funding round led by dmg ventures and BYVP to support its alcohol consumption reduction platform.

Nul, a London-based digital health startup focused on alcohol consumption reduction services, announced a €840,000 ($1 million approximately) Seed funding round to support its UK commercial launch, expand operations, and lay groundwork for international growth.

## Funding and Investors

The financing was led by **dmg ventures**, the corporate venture arm of Daily Mail and General Trust, and **BYVP**, joined by angel investors from technology, healthcare, and consumer sectors. The capital is earmarked for hiring clinical and product staff, customer acquisition, and future market entry, including the United States.

## Company Model and Offerings

Founded by **Matus Maar**, former co-founder of Talis Capital and current CEO of Nul, the platform combines remote clinical consultations, prescription services, and structured digital pathways to assist users seeking to reduce alcohol intake. 

The core programme centres on **naltrexone**, an FDA-approved opioid antagonist medication used in treatment protocols for alcohol use disorder. Nul’s service is subscription-based and delivered entirely online, with structured behavioural support influenced by **The Sinclair Method**, a pharmacological “extinction” approach designed to weaken the reinforcement of alcohol consumption.

## Medical Context for Naltrexone and Treatment Methods

Naltrexone has regulatory approval in the United States and other jurisdictions for alcohol use disorder and has been shown in clinical research to reduce cravings and consumption compared to placebo in several measures of drinking behaviour. 

The Sinclair Method, developed from scientific research on reward pathways, prescribes taking naltrexone prior to alcohol exposure to block reinforcing neurochemical effects and gradually reduce the compulsion to drink. Evidence and expert communities note that outcomes can vary and that the approach is not universally recommended as first-line treatment in clinical guidelines due to mixed high-quality evidence.

## Market Traction

Nul reports it initiated a UK test phase in summer 2025, onboarding over 120 paying customers and achieving an annualised revenue run-rate near €344,000. The company plans a public crowdfunding campaign on Republic Europe to involve retail investors in the next growth phase and anticipates further fundraising in 2026 as scale increases.

## Sector Context

The UK health technology sector has attracted substantial investor interest, with combined startup valuations reaching tens of billions of pounds in recent years, reflecting broader digital health and consumer health technology momentum.

## Implications and Future Outlook

Digital and remote approaches to alcohol reduction reflect broader shifts in health provision towards telehealth, consumer-centric treatment, and technology-enabled behavioural support. As companies like Nul expand, they may influence how services intersect with traditional care pathways and regulatory environments, but the clinical and public health communities continue to emphasize a range of evidence-based strategies rather than single methods or tools.
