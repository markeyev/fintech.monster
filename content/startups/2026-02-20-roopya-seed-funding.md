Summary: Kolkata and Gurugram-based fintech startup Roopya raises ₹4 crore in seed funding led by Inflection Point Ventures to scale its no-code lending infrastructure and expand its market footprint.

**Kolkata and Gurugram, India.** Fintech infrastructure startup **Roopya**, a software-as-a-service (SaaS) company offering cloud-native lending solutions, has closed a ₹4 crore seed funding round led by **Inflection Point Ventures**, with participation from **Adelaar Consulting LLP**, according to reports published on February 20, 2026.

Roopya’s platform automates basic lending functions and allows financial institutions to launch digitally customized loan products within a few days instead of months, addressing a core bottleneck in India’s digital credit ecosystem.

## Platform and Market Positioning

Roopya offers a no-code **Lending-as-a-Service** stack that includes a fully automated Loan Origination System covering customer onboarding, e-KYC, underwriting, disbursement, and collections while complying with Reserve Bank of India (RBI) guidelines. The system supports rapid product deployment and is positioned for lenders seeking to replace legacy systems with cloud-based alternatives.

The company is among the first Indian fintech firms recognized as a "Specified User" under the RBI’s CICRA Act of 2022, a regulatory classification that grants access to consumer credit bureau data for risk analytics and underwriting.

## Operational Footprint and Performance Metrics

Roopya says its infrastructure supports more than 20 lending partners across 10 Indian states and over 1,100 point-of-sale terminals. The company’s tech stack processes over 30,000 loan applications monthly and has facilitated more than ₹100 crore in loans in the current fiscal year, with reported month-on-month growth of 15 to 20 percent. 

Supporting claims by Roopya and its investors, the platform reportedly helps lenders reduce operational costs by up to 30 percent, cut default rates by roughly 25 percent, and halve processing time compared with traditional workflows. 

## Investor and Founder Perspective

**Inflection Point Ventures** is an Indian angel investment platform that has backed over 280 startups. The firm’s co-founder, **Ankur Mittal**, stated that Roopya’s integrated platform addresses a crucial gap in lending technology and could make credit more accessible in a volatile credit market.

Roopya was co-founded by **Sudipta Kumar Ghosh** and **Raman Vig**. Ghosh previously served in leadership roles at Tata Administrative Services and Tata Capital, while Vig held senior positions at CRIF, HDFC Bank, Deutsche Bank, and ICICI Bank. Their experience spans institutional credit operations and enterprise technology.

## Sector Context

India’s digital lending market is expanding rapidly, with projections that digital loan disbursements could cross ₹3.6 lakh crore by 2030. Roopya’s seed round and positioning align with this structural shift, highlighting investor interest in middleware and infrastructure layers that abstract core banking functions through software. 

The deployment of AI and no-code interfaces may improve operational efficiency, but broader adoption will depend on measurable risk outcomes and integration with established financial systems as the sector faces challenges related to risk management and regulatory complexity.
