Summary: Bedfordshire-based biotech company Tozaro raises £6 million led by Mercia Ventures to advance its Smart Polymer technology, aimed at lowering the astronomical costs of viral vector production for cell and gene therapies.

**Tozaro**, a biotechnology company headquartered in Bedfordshire, United Kingdom, has completed a £6 million (approximately €6.9 million) funding round led by **Mercia Ventures** through the Midlands Engine Investment Fund II and its own capital, with continued participation from existing backers. This infusion increases Tozaro’s total capital raised to approximately £23.7 million since its founding in 2015.

The company develops **Smart Polymer** technology for use in the production of viral vectors, which are a core component of many cell and gene therapies. These therapies offer potential cures for certain cancers and rare genetic conditions but are frequently limited by extremely high manufacturing costs, which can exceed several hundreds of thousands of pounds per patient.

## Smart Polymers: A Chemical Alternative to Proteins

Smart Polymers are synthetic reagents created with molecular modelling and machine learning to bind selectively to viral vectors such as lentiviral or adeno‑associated virus (AAV) particles used in therapeutic delivery. 

Unlike conventional protein‑based capture and purification methods, Smart Polymers expand the chemical design space beyond the roughly 20 amino acids found in natural proteins to libraries of hundreds of chemical groups. This allows for more stable, cost‑effective, and customizable purification processes.

## Investor Context and Market Potential

The lead investor, **Mercia Asset Management**, is a UK capital manager with about £2 billion in assets that supports regional technology ventures. Post‑round, Mercia holds roughly 11.9% of Tozaro on a fully diluted basis. 

Mercia’s public filings underscore the potential of this market, noting that cell and gene therapy sectors already include more than 70 approved products and over 3,400 in active development, with market valuations poised for significant growth.

## Scaling Deployment and Commercial Partnerships

Tozaro plans to use the fresh capital to establish commercial partnerships and scale deployment of its Smart Polymer platform with downstream manufacturing partners. The technology has already undergone testing with vector manufacturers and is being tailored for improving yield and purification in both CAR‑T and broader gene therapy applications.

Viral vector production is a recognized bottleneck across the gene therapy sector, where large contract development and manufacturing organizations (CDMOs) such as **Lonza**, **Thermo Fisher Scientific**, and **Oxford Biomedica** are investing heavily to expand capacity and efficiency.

## Implications for the Biotech Manufacturing Landscape

Cost reduction in viral vector production affects not only pricing pressures on health systems but also the scalability of complex biologics. Innovations in affinity reagents like Smart Polymers may incrementally improve yields and reduce process waste, potentially unlocking broader clinical access to life‑saving treatments. 

However, adoption depends on integration with established industrial practices and regulatory acceptance within GMP workflows. The emergence of alternative manufacturing solutions signals a shift toward modularizing and industrializing bioprocessing, where platform technologies like Tozaro's compete alongside traditional methods to shape the future of medicine.
