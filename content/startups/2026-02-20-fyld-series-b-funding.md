Summary: London-based FYLD secures €34 million in Series B funding led by Energy Impact Partners to accelerate the deployment of its AI-powered operational intelligence platform across global infrastructure sectors.

**London, UK.** FYLD, a technology startup developing an AI-powered frontline intelligence platform for the infrastructure sector, has announced a **€34 million** (approximately $41 million) Series B funding round. The investment was led by **Energy Impact Partners** with participation from **Partech** through its Growth Impact Fund. The funding follows 82 percent year-over-year revenue growth in 2025 and is aimed at accelerating product scaling, particularly in the United States.

FYLD’s platform is designed to bring real-time operational intelligence to large, distributed fieldwork environments in sectors such as energy, construction, and water utilities.

## AI for Distributed Field Operations

Instead of traditional static forms and delayed reporting, frontline workers capture short videos of ongoing tasks. These videos are analyzed by FYLD’s AI models to identify safety, quality, and delivery risks before they escalate into costly delays or incidents.

Managers receive live visibility into work progress without increasing supervisory headcount, and all actions are documented for compliance and audit purposes. FYLD reports that some customers have reduced serious worksite injuries by up to 48 percent and achieved measurable productivity gains within weeks of deployment.

## Market Dynamics and Strategic Expansion

Investors describe FYLD’s technology as addressing a long-standing gap in digital tools for frontline operations in infrastructure and utilities. Backers argue that legacy systems often deliver insight too late to prevent rework or safety issues.

FYLD plans to use the new capital to deepen its product development and expand its geographic footprint, especially in North America where infrastructure demand is high. The company has added several large engineering and construction clients in the United States and expects more than 40 percent of its revenue to originate there by the end of 2026.

## Sector Context

The funding round sits within a wider global venture capital environment where AI-driven B2B software, particularly in industrial and field-oriented domains, continues to attract capital. Analysts note that this funding milestone underscores a maturing segment within AI adoption. 

Tools that integrate directly with frontline workflows and surface actionable intelligence at the point of work are gaining traction because they promise near-term return on investment, contrasting with the multi-year deployments typical of legacy enterprise software.
